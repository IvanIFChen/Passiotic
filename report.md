# Final Project Report

#### Subtitle

## Part 1: Goal and Motivation

The purpose of this project is to build a scanning system which is capable of passively observing network packets to determine the density of an area.
The system should be small and scalabe; new nodes should be able to be added to increase the overall scanning area.

## Part 2: Design Choices

In this section, we discuss detail the hardware and software components necessary to build the system.
In the next section, we discuss how we connected these components.

We needed the following hardware components to build our system:

* Antenna
* Computer	*(TODO - is this the right word? change subsection too)*
* Battery

In addition, we created the following software components:

* Backend
* Frontend

### Antenna

*TODO*

To discuss:

* What did we use?
* Why did we use it?
	* monitor mode

### Computer

*TODO*

To discuss:

* What did we use?
	* raspberry pi
* Why did we use it?
	* small, portable

### Battery

*TODO*

To discuss:

* What did we use?
	* portable battery
* Why did we use it?
	* pi needed to be power
	* could use a wall outlet, if available

### Backend

*TODO*

To discuss:

* What did we use?
* Why did we use it?
	* needed the pis to be able to give their data to something

### Frontend

*TODO*

To discuss:

* What did we use?
* Why did we use it?

## Part 3: Implementation

*TODO*

To discuss:

* Our program for receiving packets
	* monitor mode
	* Wireshark, tshark
	* MAC addresses
* Filtering
	* why?
	* how?
* Connecting the pis to the backend
* Viewing the frontend

## Part 4: Evaluation

*TODO*

To discuss:

* Look at our data.
* What does it mean.


## Part 5: Challenges

*TODO*

To discuss:

* Challenges

## Part 6: Possible Future Improvements

*TODO*

To discuss:

* Other identifiers (instead of MACs)
* Filtering
	* could not find a complete prefix list
	* always seemed like there were MAC address not on the list
